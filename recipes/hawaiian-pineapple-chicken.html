    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <h4>For the chicken & the marinade:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 kg chicken thighs</li>
      <li>150ml soy sauce</li>
      <li>600ml water</li>
      <li>130ml coconut milk</li>
      <li>67g dark brown sugar</li>
      <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon grated ginger</li>
      <li>1/3 teaspoon sesame seed oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>for the sauce:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>500ml pineapple juice</li>
      <li>55g dark brown sugar</li>
      <li>60g ketchup</li>
      <li>60ml soy sauce</li>
      <li>60ml rice vinegar</li>
      <li>3 garlic cloves</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons grated ginger</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In an extra-large bowl whisk together the soy sauce, water, coconut
        milk, brown sugar, garlic, ginger, and sesame seed oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the chicken thighs and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at
        least 1 hour and up to 8 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large saucepan whisk together the pineapple juice, brown sugar,
        ketchup, soy sauce, rice vinegar, garlic, and ginger. Heat on high heat
        until boiling. Then, reduce to medium heat and simmer until the sauce is
        reduced and it has thickened (there should be about 1 cup of sauce),
        about 25 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer the sauce to a bowl and cover with plastic wrap (the sauce will
        thicken even more as it cools).
      </li>
      <li>
        15 minutes before youâ€™re ready to grill, turn all of the burners to high
        and cover the grill. Scrape the grill and lightly oil the grates with
        canola oil. Add the chicken, skin side up, cover the grill, and reduce
        the heat to medium-low (or around 325 degrees F). Cook until the meat
        registers 120 degrees F, about 15-20 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Flip the chicken so now the skin side is down. Cover and grill until the
        meat registers 170-175 degrees F, about another 15-20 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer the chicken to a serving platter and brush with half of the
        glaze. Garnish with sliced green onions and serve with extra pineapple
        barbecue sauce.
      </li>
    </ol>
