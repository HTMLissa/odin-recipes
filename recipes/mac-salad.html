      <li>5 green onions</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a medium bowl whisk together the milk, cream, mayonnaise, grated
        onion, dark brown sugar, 1 teaspoon of salt, and 2 teaspoons of pepper
        until smooth. Refrigerate until needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook the macaroni as per the package instructions, except add 5 minutes
        to the cooking time on the package instructions (you want the macaroni
        to be very soft and plump so it absorbs the dressing better).
      </li>
      <li>
        Drain the macaroni into a colander and then dump it back into the pot.
        Add in the apple cider vinegar and stir until the pasta absorbs the
        vinegar. Cover the pot with a lid and cool for 20 minutes at room
        temperature.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add half of the dressing and stir to combine. Then, cover the lid and
        cool for another 20 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add in the remaining dressing, green onions, celery, and carrots to the
        pot and stir to combine, and season with salt and pepper if needed.
      </li>
      <li>Cool completely to room temperature, about 30 more minutes.</li>
      <li>
        Transfer the macaroni salad to a bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Chill
        in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours before serving.
