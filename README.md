<h1>My first project through the Odin Project!</h1> 
<p>A simple website with recipes.</p> 
<p>This project taught me to write even cleaner HTML code and to structure my files and folders even better and more efficiently.</p>
<p>In addition, the project helped me train how to use Git & Github through the command line.</p>
